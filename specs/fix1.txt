You've provided an excellent bug report. The detailed output is extremely helpful.

Let's break down the failure and fix the script.

### Analysis of the Test Failure

1.  **The Core Problem:** Your test script fails at the very first step, "API Connectivity & Auth". The `curl` command to `${WEBUI_URL}/api/v1/models` is not receiving a JSON response as expected. Instead, it's getting the full HTML of the Open WebUI frontend (`index.html`).

2.  **The `jq` Error:** The error message `jq: parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 10` is a symptom, not the cause. `jq` is a tool for parsing JSON. When you feed it an HTML document, it fails to parse it and gives a somewhat cryptic error. The real issue is the HTML response itself.

3.  **Why is HTML Being Returned?** In modern web applications like this (a Single-Page Application or SPA), it's common for the web server to be configured to serve the `index.html` file for any path it doesn't recognize. This allows the frontend (which runs in the browser) to handle its own routing. Your API call is not being correctly routed to the FastAPI backend, so the server is falling back to serving the web page.

### The Fix: Correcting the Test Script's Expectation

There is a subtle but critical flaw in your test script's validation logic for the first test.

*   **Your script checks:** `if ! echo "$response" | jq -e 'type == "array"' >/dev/null;`
*   **The Problem:** The `/api/v1/models` endpoint does not return a raw JSON array (`[...]`). It returns a JSON **object** that *contains* an array, in the format `{"data": [...]}`.

Because the check `type == "array"` fails on an object, your script incorrectly flags the test as a failure, even if the API were responding correctly. The incorrect `curl` response (HTML) is a separate issue we'll also fix, but this logical error in the test itself needs correction.

The corrected `jq` command should be: `jq -e '.data | type == "array"'`. This checks that the `data` key within the JSON object is an array.

### Revised and Improved Test Suite

Here is a more robust version of your test suite. I've corrected the `jq` validation and added more detailed error handling to help diagnose any future issues.

### Key Improvements in the New Script:

1.  **Correct API Response Check:** The `jq` command in `test_api_connectivity` is now `jq -e '.data | type == "array"'`, which correctly validates the expected JSON object structure.
2.  **HTTP Status Code Check:** The script now explicitly checks if the HTTP status code is `200`. If not, it prints the error and fails immediately, which is much clearer than a `jq` parsing error.
3.  **Better Variable Handling:** It now uses `export` to pass the `KB_ID` between test functions and `unset` at the end to clean up. It also uses a subshell `(eval ...)` to run tests, preventing variables from leaking accidentally.
4.  **Idempotent KB Creation:** The `test_create_kb` function was good, but I've slightly tweaked the `jq` query to be more robust in case no KBs exist initially.
5.  **Requires `PROJECT_ID`:** The script now requires `PROJECT_ID` as an environment variable to make the `gcloud` command for restarting the service more reliable.

Please run this updated script. It should now correctly validate your infrastructure and provide much more informative output if any step fails.
